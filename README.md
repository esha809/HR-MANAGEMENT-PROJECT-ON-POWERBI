The HR management system is a
comprehensive data source containing
information about employees, such as their
demographics, job roles, performance, and
employment status. The script systematically
cleans, organizes, and enhances the dataset to
ensure data consistency, usability, and
meaningful insights for HR-related decisionmaking.
